Most bootstrap pages look similar. Bootstrap is a great tool for simple landing pages.

But what if I want to create a beautiful site full of animation and with a non-standard placement of content?

This repository is the answer to your question. I hope that my struggle with flexbox will inspire someone. Of course, this code could be better - It would be good to work on performances. Also, I would change a few things in this layout, but what will happen? We'll see in the next commit ;) Have a nice day!
